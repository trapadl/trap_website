          <h1>About MBC</h1>
          <p class="intro-text">
            Welcome to the Master Bartending Championship. The Master Bartending Championship is an organisation aimed at growing attention to the creative world of bartending in all its forms. As one of the oldest occupations in the world, the art of hospitality has been shaped by many decades of collective thought, bringing it to where it stands today. Yet, much of it remains unnoticed. By refining and highlighting the most attractive aspects of creative bartending, the Master Bartending Championship seeks to establish a platform akin to other elite sports around the world.
          </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What does that mean?</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
              Many series of events are hosted at venues across Adelaide and Australia by the Master Bartending Championship, which initially plans on formalising three categories of bartending. This allows bartenders to compete to be the best in that category within a league.

                <h3 class="category-title">Flair Bartending</h3>
                <p>A mesmerizing display of cocktail artistry is showcased by flair bartenders, who compete by performing acrobatic and juggling stunts with bar tools and bottles, all aimed at concocting delicious cocktails.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="category">
                <h3 class="category-title">Speed Bartending</h3>
                <p>The fastest wins. Period. Each bartender trains with the same equipment and recipe for many weeks, all to surpass not only their previous best time but also the best times ever recorded for that recipe.</p>

                <h3 class="category-title">Traditional Bartending</h3>
                <p>What is known as traditional cocktail competition involves bartenders competing to impress a panel of judges with their creativity. They are given time to present and are judged independently based on how well they meet the brief of the competition.</p>

            <div class="principle">
              <h3 class="principle-title">Freedom and Creativity</h3>
              <p class="section-content">Until now, cocktail competitions globally have almost all been supported through brand sponsorship. This model is strongly supported as it makes up the bulk of competitions available and has brought the sport to where it is today. MBC is and always will remain agnostic to a brands involvement in a cocktail competition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
              <h3 class="principle-title">Making the Subjective Objective</h3>
              <p class="section-content">Transparency in judging results is just the beginning of creating a true and fair sporting competition. Each judgement is ensured to be made independently of external opinion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
              <h3 class="principle-title">Becoming the Best Above All Else</h3>
              <p class="section-content">Strong and friendly competition among competitors is paramount. Many competitors already invest hundreds of dollars preparing for competitions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle">
              <h3 class="principle-title">You in Your Drink</h3>
              <p class="section-content">Bartenders, being some of the most interesting people, play a key role in platform growth by telling stories to a target audience.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">How is it ranked?</h2>
            <div class="rankings-info">
              <p class="section-content">
                The <strong>Master Bartending Championship (MBC)</strong> ranking system is inspired by <strong>Glicko</strong>, 
                a refined version of the Elo rating system originally designed for chess, but adapted here for bartending competitions. 
                A player's rating is not just a simple accumulation of points; instead, it dynamically adjusts based on performance, 
                competition difficulty, and statistical confidence in their skill level.
              </p>
            
              <p class="section-content">
                Each bartender has three key variables that influence how their ranking changes after each competition:
              </p>
            
              <ul class="section-content">
                <li><strong>Rating (R):</strong> Represents a bartender's estimated skill level.</li>
                <li><strong>Rating Deviation (RD):</strong> Measures uncertainty in the rating. A high RD means the system is less confident 
                    in a player's true skill level, leading to larger rating adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility (σ):</strong> Accounts for fluctuations in a player's performance. A bartender who competes infrequently 
                    or shows inconsistent results will have a higher volatility, causing their rating to shift more aggressively.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p class="section-content">
                Competitions are weighted based on their prestige and difficulty. Winning a <strong>highly competitive event</strong> 
                results in a greater rating increase compared to winning a smaller contest. Likewise, <strong>defeating higher-ranked competitors</strong> 
                provides a larger rating boost, whereas losing to lower-ranked competitors results in a more significant drop.
              </p>
            
              <p class="section-content">
                Additionally, the system includes a <strong>time decay factor</strong>, meaning older results gradually lose influence. 
                This ensures that rankings reflect a bartender’s <strong>current</strong> skill level rather than past achievements. 
                Only a bartender’s <strong>best performances</strong> over a rolling period are factored into their final score, 
                preventing someone from climbing the ranks purely through frequent participation.
              </p>

              <p class="section-content">
                Note that this system is constantly undergoing improvements. As results are added to the platform, frequent recalculations of all results will occur and your variables may change unexpectedly as a result.
